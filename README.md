# Materialize, SCSS and TS
This is a basic HTML boilerplate with Materialize production version pre-imported in the `index.html` file. This boilerplate uses Typescript and SCSS compilers with Rollup module bundler. This boilerplate has no integrated development server. Use one that comes with your IDE or code editor.

To build the SCSS and TS files:

```BASH
  npm run build
```

To start watching the SCSS and TS files:

```BASH
  npm run dev
```
