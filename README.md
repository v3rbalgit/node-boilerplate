# node-boilerplate

Collection of web development boilerplates for different project sizes and complexity. All boilerplates are using npm and are therefore most suited for Node.js applications. Each boilerplate includes useful comments where necessary for easier orientation.

### **Usage**
Each branch of this repository corresponds to a different boilerplate. To start a new project using one of the boilerplates, clone this repository to your preferred location:

```BASH
  git clone https://github.com/v3rbalgit/node-boilerplate.git project_name
```

*Note: You can provide custom name for the target directory.*

After you have cloned this repository, by default the target directory will be pretty much empty, containing just basic files like `LICENSE`, `.gitignore` and `README.md`.

Select your boilerplate by checking out to a different branch. For example, here we first navigate to our working directory and then select a simple boilerplate that has the Bootstrap framework and jQuery library imported:

```BASH
  cd project_name
  git checkout -b bootstrap+jquery
```

Your working directory will load up the selected boilerplate. All you need to do now is install the boilerplate's dependencies:

```BASH
  npm install
```

And that's it, you can start working!

### **Contribute**
Feel free to contribute to any of the boilerplates or submit a pull request and start a new one if you feel none of the boilerplates fill your specific niche.
